# KeyHooker
### Keyhooker for macOS (works perfectly on macOS 10.11.6)

IMPORTANT: requires root

  This app allows to disable different keys. For example, you would like to disable 'A'-key after pressing 'B'-key within 200 ms. You just need to click button "Add key" and press needed key. It will appear in the table. After type required delay and keys you want to disable (if you want to disable 'Q', 'W', 'E', 'R', 'T', 'Y', type 'qwerty'). On the picture below you may see keys, allowed for disabling.

  If you would like to lock some shortcuts, you also can do it (small lifehack). For example, you need to lock CMD+C and CMD+V. So, add CMD, set delay about 10 seconds and disable 'C' and 'V'. You got it!
  If you need delete some keys from table, simply select it and press "Remove key".
  
  Also this app has hidden mode, which allows you to spy for someone's Mac. It will send key- and mouse-log to typed E-mail. Just type your E-mail, size of file to send and check "Run app in hidden mode next time (restart app)". Click "Save and" restart an app. It will dissapear from Dock. Well, you'll still see it in System Monitoring.
  If you need to hide your app (for example, you disabled shortcuts and do not want to see app in your Dock), just press the next:
                                        CMD LEFT, CMD RIGHT, h, o, o, k, e, r
  To unhide app type the same key sequence.
  NOTE: type keys for hide/unhide separately.

  I'm new to macOS delelopment, so, give some feedback if you don't like something and want me to change it.
